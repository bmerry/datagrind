The file format consists of a sequence of records. Records are binary and of
variable length. They use the host's endianness and word size (here "word"
means the size of a pointer); there is sufficient header information to
determine this from the file itself.  Addresses in the file may be misaligned,
so it is not suitable for using directly with mmap.

The first byte contains the record type. If bit 7 of the record type is 0, then
the second byte contains the entire payload. Otherwise, the second byte
contains the length of the record in bytes, excluding the first two bytes. The
length 255 is reserved for future use.

The available record types are:

- DG_R_HEADER(0)
The first record in the file. Followed by
  - The bytes 'D', 'A', 'T', 'A', 'G', 'R', 'I', 'N', 'D', '1', '\0'
  - file format version (byte)
  - 1 for big-endian, 0 for little-endian (byte)
  - word size (byte)

- DG_R_READ(1), DG_R_WRITE(2)
Indicates a data read or write. This is followed by
  - the size of the access (byte)
  - the address of the access (word).

- DG_R_TRACK_RANGE(3)
Indicates a DATAGRIND_TRACK_RANGE client request. This is followed by
  - an address (1 word)
  - a length (1 word)
  - a type name (NUL-terminated string)
  - a label (NUL-terminated string).

- DG_R_UNTRACK_RANGE(4)
Indicates a DATAGRIND_UNTRACK_RANGE client request. This is followed by
  - an address (1 word)
  - a length (1 word)

- DG_R_START_EVENT(5), DG_R_END_EVENT(6)
Indicates a DATAGRIND_START_EVENT/DATAGRIND_END_EVENT client request. This is
followed by
  - a label (NUL-terminated string)
