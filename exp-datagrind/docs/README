The file format consists of a sequence of records. Records are binary and of
variable length. They use the host's endianness and word size (here "word"
means the size of a pointer); there is sufficient header information to
determine this from the file itself.  Addresses in the file may be misaligned,
so it is not suitable for using directly with mmap.

The first byte contains bitfields, made up as follows:

3:0   Record type
6:4   Record subtype
7:7   Short record

If bit 7 of the first byte is 0, then the second byte contains the entire
payload. Otherwise, the second byte contains the length of the record in bytes,
excluding the first two bytes. The length 255 is reserved for future use.

Where a record does not specify subtypes, the subtype field must be zero.

The available record types are:

- DG_R_HEADER(0)
The first record in the file. Followed by
  - The bytes 'D', 'A', 'T', 'A', 'G', 'R', 'I', 'N', 'D', '1', '\0'
  - file format version (byte)
  - 1 for big-endian, 0 for little-endian (byte)
  - word size (byte)

- DG_R_READ(1), DG_R_WRITE(2)
Indicates a data read or write. This is followed by
  - the size of the access (byte)
  - the address of the access (word).

- DG_R_RANGE(3)
Indicates a DATAGRIND_TRACK_RANGE client request. This is followed by
  - an address (1 word)
  - a length (1 word)
  - a type name (NUL-terminated string)
  - a label (NUL-terminated string).
